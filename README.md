# Disaster management

    Often at times of natural calamities, in addtion to prediction and forecasting we believe that good planning and proper execution of relief operations is very crucial to save many lives and reduce economic loss. So we decided to work on optimizing the disaster management process and which shall aid ...
 Idea:
    Our idea is to design and implement an algorithm which tries to efficiently manage resources and helps in plannning out rescue operations at times of natural calamities given the constraints.
 Implementation:
    We look forward to model the hot routes, areas under concern, and people(as far as possible) with parameters like satisfaction, available work force, space and time constraints, resources. Then we would apply the particle swarm optimisation technique to find the best possible ways to allocate resources at the correct times to mitigate damage and increase saisfation. 
    The key idea is to keep it as abstract as possible to be able to use under any disaster. 
Inputs: Available resources, Work force, Hot routes, areas and people under concern
Output: A chronological order of steps to be taken.

Impact: Sometimes when a disaster hits a city the work force is allocated to that city, but if it has hit another city in matter of hours we have no workforce to allocate to it. Also we cannot entirely allocate resources and workforce for evacuation alone, since we need to use some for analysing ways to mitigate the damage. Using the optimisation we can arrange these segments of workers to appropriate sectors
